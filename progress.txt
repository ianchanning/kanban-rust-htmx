# Progress Log - Project Reaper

## Phase 0: The Ledger (Foundational Law)
- [x] Create `event_log` table (append-only)
- [x] Enforce write-only semantics at the DB layer (Triggers)
- [x] Define event schema and types (Rust structs)

## Phase 1: The Hull (Foundation)

- [x] Initialize Rust workspace (Axum, SQLx, Tokio)

- [x] Configure SQLite + migrations

- [x] "Hello Captain" route

- [x] Implement Tailwind CSS build pipeline

- [x] Verify Ledger integration on all mutations (Implemented append_event helper)

## Phase 2: The Deck (The Board)

- [x] Create Database Schema: `notes`, `wip_groups`.
- [x] Implement CRUD for `Notes` (Titles and Colors only).
- [x] Build the Main Dashboard: Multi-column layout with Tailwind (Submarine Vibe).
- [x] Implement Spatial Reordering: Simple reordering logic (move up/down).

## Phase 3: The Pulse (The Heartbeat)

- [x] Create Sprite Registry: Track active sigils (🦂A, etc., TTL)
- [x] Implement HTMX OOB Updates: Endpoints for sigil status fragments.
- [x] Build the Heartbeat Watchdog: Background task to check Sprite TTLs.
- [x] Integrate Sigil UI: Display live status next to WIP Groups.

## Phase 4: The Safety Net

- [x] Implement Event Middleware: Every state change must append to `event_log`.
- [x] Build the "Rewind" Logic: Functionality to reconstruct state from the ledger.
- [x] Implement the "Sonar Ping": UI mechanism to re-sync state on reconnect.

## Phase 5: The Red Handle (Emergency Blow)

- [x] Implement the "Red Handle" Trigger: UI button to reset state.
- [x] Backend Emergency Blow (stateless rebuild)
- [x] Sprite Clean-Room Protocol: Automated `git reset --hard` hooks when switching notes.
- [x] Optional Integration: Connect the Red Handle to `lsprite.sh` logic (if possible via environment/shell).

## Current Status: BLOCKED

### 1. Compilation Failure (Critical)
The project currently fails to compile with **128 errors**. Primary issues include:
- **SQLx Type Mapping:** `no built in mapping found for type DATETIME` for `last_seen`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`.
- **Missing Symbols:** `models::ReorderNote` is imported in `main.rs` but not defined in `models.rs`.
- **Trait Bounds:** `Transaction` does not implement `Executor` for `append_event` calls.
- **Type Incompatibility:** `match` arms in `main.rs` return conflicting types (`Html<String>` vs `Response<Body>`).
- **Clone Missing:** `UpdateNote` does not implement `Clone` but is cloned in `main.rs`.

### 2. Infrastructure Conflict
- **Path Desync:** The implementation assumes `lsprite.sh` is in the workspace, but the authoritative script is located at `/root/mothership/lsprite.sh`.
- **Modularity:** The Kanban Forge is a viewer, but the `lsprite.sh` integration implies host-level orchestration which is currently outside the workspace scope.

## Deployment & Verification

- [ ] Build via `lsprite.sh build`
- [ ] SQLx query verification in CI
- [ ] Simulated Sprite death (Depth-Crush test)
- [ ] Browser reload + network interruption tests

## Commit: lynx-alpha - Implemented Sprite Clean-Room Protocol
Implemented the automated `git reset --hard` and `git clean -fd` hooks to run when a note's `wip_group_id` is changed via the `update_note` API endpoint. This ensures the Sprite's environment is cleaned to prevent context leakage as per the Bulkhead Failure protocol in `SPEC.md`.

---

## Commit: lynx-alpha - Implemented Optional lsprite.sh Integration
Modified `admin_emergency_blow` to conditionally execute `lsprite.sh reset-cave` if the `LSPRITE_SH_PATH` environment variable is set. This fulfills the optional integration task for the Red Handle.

---

## Constraints

- HTMX must never perform primary state transitions
- UI is reflection, not authority
- All recovery paths must flow through the Ledger

## Alert: Infrastructure Conflict
Identified a fundamental problem in the Implementation Plan:
- The plan (Phase 5 and Deployment) assumes 'lsprite.sh' exists within the workspace for build and integration purposes.
- Reality: 'lsprite.sh' is located in the home directory (/root/mothership/lsprite.sh), outside the project workspace.
- Integration attempts with the Red Handle and Deployment steps are currently blocked by this architectural assumption.## Phase 6: Stabilization (Submarine-Alpha)
- [x] Fixed SQLx type mapping for NaiveDateTime.
- [x] Resolved HTMX response type mismatches in main.rs.
- [x] Fixed borrow checker issue in heartbeat_watchdog.
- [ ] Resolving persistent i64 vs Option<i64> desync in Note models.

## Phase 6: Stabilization (Submarine-Alpha) - Part 2
- [x] Fixed syntax errors in main.rs (watchdog).
- [x] Aligned wip_group_id comparisons in main.rs.
- [ ] Blocked on persistent SQLx type inference issue for Note model fields (wip_group_id, position).
